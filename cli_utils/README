Some standalone tools to assist with hacking Nissan ECU ROMs.
If you don't know what these do, you probably don't need them.

Compile with any C compiler. gcc example:
gcc nisckfix2.c nislib.c -o nisckfix2.exe

etc.


Most of these are licensed under GPLv3, which has certain restrictions. Here is a short summary:

(emphasis mine. Source: https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v3-(gpl-3) )

You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files.
Any modifications to or **software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code** must also be made available under the GPL along with build & install instructions.


Commercial uses is possible, but **all code linked with GPL 3.0 source code must be disclosed under a GPL 3.0 compatible license.**

If you find all or parts of **nissutils** useful, please consider a donation. There is no amount too small, every 1$ is appreciated. That is a great way to motivate me to continue adding to, and improving these tools.
