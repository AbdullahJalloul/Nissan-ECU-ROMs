Collection of files to replace IDA's standard "sh3.cfg" file, adding

- memory area definitions
- peripheral register name defines
- interrupt vector labels

The basic register defines are taken from dschultz' versions he posts on this thread:
http://www.romraider.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=5825

The "SH705x_IVT" variants have a special tweak intended for Nissan ROMs that have only a partial
vector table at address 0; their reset code then sets the vbr register to point at the complete table @ 0x1000 or some other address. You must determine it beforehand to select the correct variant when loading the ROM.

*** Files
- sh3_dschultz.cfg is dschultz' original version;
- 705*_additions.txt are the interrupt vectors and slightly different mem area definitions
- sh3_705x_regs.cfg are only the register names (not usable by itself)
- sh3_705x_notwin.cfg is the dschultz version augmented with everything except the "twinVT" variants
- sh3_full.cfg includes everything. Recommended for analyzing Nissan ROMs

*** How to use
- backup the original sh3.cfg file (look in the IDA directory, inside cfg/)
- copy "sh3_full.cfg" in there, and rename it to sh3.cfg
