Collection of files to replace IDA's standard "sh3.cfg" file, adding

- memory area definitions
- peripheral register name defines
- interrupt vector labels

The basic register defines are taken from dschultz' versions he posts on this thread:
http://www.romraider.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=40&t=5825

The "SH705x_IVT" variants have a special tweak intended for Nissan ROMs that have only a partial
vector table at address 0; their reset code then sets the vbr register to point at the complete table @ 0x1000.

*** Files
sh3_dschultz.cfg it dschultz' standard version;
705*_additions.txt are the interrupt vectors and slightly different mem area definitions
sh3_705x_regs.cfg are only the register names
sh3_705x_notwin.cfg is the dschultz version augmented with everything except the "twinVT" variants
sh3_full.cfg includes everything.
